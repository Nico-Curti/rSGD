## Python Installation

First of all ensure that a right Python version is installed (Python >= 3.6 is required).
The [Anaconda/Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) python version is recomended.

Download the project or the latest release:

```
git clone https://github.com/Nico-Curti/rSGD
cd rSGD
```


### Installing prerequisites

To install the prerequisites type:

```
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

### Installation from sources

In the `rSGD` directory execute:

```
python setup.py install
```

or for installing in development mode:

```
python setup.py develop --user
```
